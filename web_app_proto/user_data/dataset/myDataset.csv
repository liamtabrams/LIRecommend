Job OverviewCoactive makes it easy to search, filter, and analyze visual content. Increasingly image and video data captures the content we watch, the products we buy, and the work we do, and already represents 80% of internet traffic. But rather than being an asset, visual content is often a tax or even a liability because it is so hard to work with and understand. Coactive solves this by bringing structure to unstructured visual data. Rather than spending months (or years) building complex infrastructure, data teams can unlock the value of their visual data in minutes to power use cases such as content understanding and moderation, search, and analytics.Coactive was founded by experts who shaped the fields of high-performance deep learning and data-centric AI. We have the scars from building and working with the first generation of modern machine learning systems at Google, Meta, Pinterest, eBay, Lyft, and other leading organizations. Through our decades of experience, we have developed a playbook to democratize the toughest parts of machine learning systems; no PhD required.This is an exceptional opportunity to work with one of Forbes' top 50 AI companies, backed by key investors such as Andreesen Horowitz and Bessemer Ventures.

About UsGibsonAI is building a suite of tools that assists developers in using AI to produce higher quality code faster. GibsonAI's output is reliable and can be shipped to production without concern for hallucinations, non-existent libraries or bugs. To achieve this we have to be very conscious of the state-of-the-art in generative AI and apply various machine learning techniques and algorithms alongside a large language model.GibsonAI also aims to help development teams make sense of the AI landscape by abstracting LLM details, what works and what does not, behind a suite of tools that are easy to use, meet the developer where they love to code and work, every time. Our main customer is a developer and they love working with our tools.As the AI landscape continues to evolve, GibsonAI will determine which is the best LLM for a particular task, when we rely on generative AI versus proprietary models and algorithms and how best to implement AI assisted tools to significantly increase the speed and accuracy of the developer.We are well funded and our team has extensive experience for this endeavor. GibsonAI is a significant innovation over what exists today and we are working fast to be the best in the space.RequirementsMinimum undergraduate degree in Computer Science or a related discipline8-12 years experience hands on codingExperience with mentorship, team leadership or managementComprehensive understanding of RDBMS systems, database design and SQLDesire to build developer tools and frameworksTechnical SkillsAnsibleAWSLarge language models (LLM)MySQL or PostgreSQLPython, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Pydantic, Alembic, pytestUnit / Integration testingUNIX command lineCore Technical Concepts(1) GibsonAI.com / RESTful APIAt its core, GibsonAI is a complex, but standard, RESTful API implementation. Part of our work is continuing to build a robust Web-based portal that allows developers and teams to interact with their accounts and projects. As an analogy for how to think about this part of the GibsonAI product, think about how Github functions.(2) heygibson (Command Line Interface)heygibson is a command line interface (CLI) tool that allows developers to interact with GibsonAI and write code on the UNIX command line. It can be fully integrated into the developer's environment and integrated the way pre-existing tools can be. heygibson brings the power of AI assisted coding to the fingertips of the developer.(3) IDE IntegrationGibsonAI meets the developer where they love to code. GibsonAI is fully integrated into popular IDE's and code editors like VS Code.(4) GibsonAI Micro-LLMTo work fast and to understand your context, GibsonAI has developed a robust micro-LLM that runs in your environment.

We love to code and now we get to build tools that empower developers to love to code using AI.We take our work product very seriously and beyond wanting to produce good code for ourselves we need to produce perfect code for customers. We unit and integration test everything. We rely on tried-and-true tools and techniques. We want to be the best at this next evolution of developer frameworks and tools.Before joining us we ask that you make sure you love to code.

About Remedy RoboticsCardiovascular disease is the #1 cause of morbidity and mortality in the world. Much of this could be prevented with better access to specialist care. Take stroke as an example: any delay in treatment can lead to permanent disability or death. However, due to a lack of specialist surgeons, the most effective intervention can only be performed in 2% of US hospitals. For patients who present to one of the 98% of hospitals that do not offer the surgery, treatment is either significantly delayed or not offered at all because timely transfer is not feasible.Our mission is to bring state-of-the-art vascular intervention to anyone, anytime, regardless of their location. Our team of medical clinicians, roboticists, and machine learning experts are working to bridge this gap by building the world’s first remotely-operated, semi-autonomous endovascular surgical robot.We’ve already done what nobody else could—using our system, doctors from around the world were able to remotely perform this procedure from as far as 8000 miles away. We now need your help to bring this technology out of the laboratory and into hospitals everywhere.The RoleWe’re looking for someone to continue leveraging our vast trove of medical imaging data in order to train and deploy deep neural network models. These models enable our surgical robot to understand and reason about both our robot and the patient’s anatomy, which ultimately gives doctors the insight and control necessary to quickly and safely complete the procedure.You WillTrain deep neural networks to detect salient features in medical imaging dataUnderstand and interpret the training data distributions and labels, and their effect on model performanceDevelop metrics that reveal neural network performance, thereby providing actionable information for improving the modelsDeploy trained neural networks on a real-time surgical robotic systemYou Have2+ years of machine learning engineering experienceExpertise with PythonExperience training image-based deep neural networks, includingEagerness to learn on the job, iterate fast, and collaborateNice to HavesStrong background in linear algebra, multivariable calculus, or optimizationExperience with cloud infrastructure toolsExpertise with deep neural networks for unsupervised learning, such as VAEs or GANs",3,115.0,200.0

# LIRecommend
The ultimate goal of this project is to design a scheme through which LinkedIn could improve it's job recommendation system.

Throughout this repository I will use the acronym POC to stand for 'Proof of Concept'. 

Currently, the work is being carried out as a capstone project for the UC San Diego Extended Studies Machine Learning Engineering Bootcamp, which I was in enrolled in on November 6, 2023.   

The following were some initial goals or visions behind this project:

- can I come up with a way that could recommend jobs from LinkedIn that are more closely aligned with my preferences? Currently LinkedIn recommends jobs based on your user profile or a combination of it and keyword searching (through LinkedIn Jobs' search feature), but there is some degree of lack of accuracy or specificity to its engine.

- the initial vision for this project involved an AI that can recommend highly personalized, realistic, and practical career growth or learning paths to users by learning from their feedback on job postings. This idea was born from my own struggle to effectively prioritize and map out an action plan that would enable me to be a truly qualified candidate for the jobs I really want. Being still on the young and inexperienced side as a software engineer, it can feel very helpless and whimsical applying to dozens of appealing software engineering jobs which unfortunately are out of reach because I just don't have enough experience or the desired qualifications for the job. Applying to these jobs in mass helps me little. You may advise me to stick to applying to jobs that are within my wheelhouse so-to-speak, but the jobs that are within my wheelhouse are not the jobs I want. So instead of spending more and more time applying to jobs that I actually want, I think the time would be better spent beefing up the resume and gaining valuable experience. Applying to jobs is like fishing, and of course fishing is a numbers game, but you can't catch a nice Mahi Mahi with crappy bait. I feel confident enough in generalizing this to other people, particurly younger individuals or those just entering a given trade, to say the following: it can be extremely difficult to effectively map and navigate a career growth path because there are so many information sources, sub-optimal actions and avenues available to people that it hinders prioritization and general decision-making. The vast sea of career opportunities and paths, especially when viewed through a job postings site, is hard for one person to sail and finding the optimal approach can be an extremely tedious and draining process. Would AI be able to help lift some of this burden? Can we build an AI that could recommend a highly efficient and detailed series of steps to someone to increase their hirability for a set of jobs? It would involve first modeling or learning the user's job preferences or feedback to job postings, and then using that knowledge to either A) enhance or filter the job recommendations provided through a given site like LinkedIn or B) combine it with other data from the user to make recommendations in a ChatGPT-like way, or both.

- for the project within the scope of the bootcamp, I will just be striving to achieve only A). 

- initially I was thinking of a tool or product that could work with postings from different websites/platforms, but for the purpose of data collection and standardization, I went on to restrict my focus to scraping exlusively LinkedIn Jobs postings.
